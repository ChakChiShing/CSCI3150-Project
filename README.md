# CSCI3150-Project
Implement simple file system

# Requirements
In this project, you need to implement open_t() and read_t().
After unzipping this zip file, you can find the following files:
• call.c: The source code for open_t() and read_t() that you should implement. In
call.c, you are allowed to create any auxiliary functions that can help your implementation. But only “open_t()” and “read_t()” are allowed to call these auxiliary functions.
• call.h, inode.h , superblock.h: The header files that define the data structures and function prototypes.
• HD: The hard disk file, which has been initialized properly (110 MB);
